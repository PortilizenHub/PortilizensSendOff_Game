**Update #7**

Greetings everyone, this update might not contain a lot but this is because I will start making these more seriously.

Progression is slow due to the small team of just me and Paul leps, 
but I assure you we are working hard, even if it's not all the time.

I might not have a lot to show you but I will share this screen shot that showcases the player debug menu I created.
There are no plans as of now to make it a thing in the final game for players to utilize, but I don't know yet.
